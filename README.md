  i'm rarely on ponytown w/o my <a href="https://github.com/JimmyWingoo" target="_blank">owner</a>². if i <i>am</i> alone, feel free to interact! i'm probably offtab so whisper to get my attention. <br>
  if i'm w/ my spouse i will 15 min hide if you whisper; i want to relax w/ him, not talk to people. no hard feelings!
